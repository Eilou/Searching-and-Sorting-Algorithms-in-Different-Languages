# worth noting, that adding a file here won't ignore from the Git index if already tracked in a 
# previous commit.
# to remove tracked files from the Git index without deleting them from the working directory, run
# git rm [-r] --cached <file path>
# the -r is useful if it is a directory you want untracked rather than specific files

# ignore any binaries generated by compilers at any level
# as the build for each type of language is small and don't want 
# to clutter up the repo
**/[Bb]in/

# [Bb] means either upper or lower case b in Bin
# ** means match to 0 or more files, hence matches to any level
# ending with a / indicates it is a directory

**/obj/
# this is another intermediate binary file, think of it as the files to build on when compiling for 
# a second time
