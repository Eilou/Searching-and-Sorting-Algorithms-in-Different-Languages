# Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithms-in-Different-Languages
*In this file are a series of key algorithms that are useful to learn. So I figured what better way to learn them, than to learn to write them in as many languages as possible. I started this project in Java and will **continue to gradually update it overtime***

## Languages complete so far:
1. Java
2. Python
3. C#

## TODO:
- Learn in C++
- Add HeapSort
- Add DFS
- Add BFS  
- Learn in Rust
